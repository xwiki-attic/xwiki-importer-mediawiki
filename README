= TODO

== REFACTORING

- the importer should produce only events instead of creating custom Page objects and to save it itself using some not efficient bridge (it saves each page metadata one by one...)
- the logger, even if it's a good idea, is not very well designed:
   - the logs should be a list of XDOM based content instead of html strings
   - it should be based on standard log api instead of having to use a special api
- attachment handling is very bad, there is a mix between pages revision and attachemt revisions
- the UI should reuse some way the work done for the WYSIWYG for macros on the parameters handling

== Missing

- import objects
- import classes
